    "# How to open .npz with PYvista\n",

    "\n",
    "Pysivsta is a 3D plotting and mesh analysis through a streamlined interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Its very well documented and has a lot of useful features that we can apply to make our plots nicer. The main PyVista page is: https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/\n",
    "\n",
    "The main caveat that there is for visualizing EUHFORIA snapshots with PyVista  is that we need to convert the grid from the .npz files into a PyVista-readable format. This can be done by using a \"new\" io file in EUHFORIA, which adds this functionality. So there are two different ways we can proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) We modify the io so that the load_heliospheric_data contains the property convert_to_pv_mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) We append the path to this new io, and use that io instead of EUHFORIA's included io. --> As I didn't want to modify EUHFORIA files, I appended the path and worked with this new io somewhere else.\n",
    "    \n",
    "NOTE: I don't import any EUHFORIA package so either path just relies on the io.\n",
